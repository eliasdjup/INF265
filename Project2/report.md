# Report Project 2 - igu011 and edj001

## Division of labor

We (igu011 and edj001) ...

## Collabaration

We have had discussions with Alvar HÃ¸nsi...

## Object Localization

### Explanation of approach and design choices

### Models and hyper-parameters utilized

### Performance of selected model

- accuracy
- IoU
- mean between of accuracy and IoU???

### Plots

#### Training

showing the true bounding boxes and label compared to the predicted bounding
boxes and labels

#### Validation

showing the true bounding boxes and label compared to the predicted bounding
boxes and labels

### Results

In case you do not get expected results, try to give potential reasons
that would explain why your code does not work and/or your results differ.

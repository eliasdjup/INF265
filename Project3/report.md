# Report Project 3 - igu011 and edj001

## Division of labor

We (igu011 and edj001) have worked very closely and paired programmed this project. Since Ingrid was sick part of the time we halted the work so that we could continue together. This is why the project is delivered a bit later since Ingrid communicated and got a postponement from Pekka.

## Collabaration

We have had discussions with Alvar HÃ¸nsi during this project. We have not shared code but exchanged ideas and sources on how to solve the subproblems that come about during this project.

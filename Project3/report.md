# Report Project 3 - igu011 and edj001

## Division of labor

We (igu011 and edj001) have worked very closely and paired programmed this project.

## Collabaration

We have had discussions with Alvar HÃ¸nsi during this project. We have not shared code but exchanged ideas and sources on how to solve the subproblems that come about during this project.

## Word embedding 
### 2.1.2: 
Comment your results.

### 2.1.5: 
Comment your results.

### 2.1.6:
Report both plots and their corresponding selections for some meaningful clusters. (Plots)

## Conjugating be and have 
### 2.2.2:
Comment the differ- ences in terms of performances/training time between the MLP architecture and the RNN architecture.

## Text generation 
### 2.3.4:
Report and comment your results.

## Report 
### 1. 
Give an explanation of your approach and design choices to help us understand how your particular implementation works.

### 2.
Report the different models and hyper-parameters you have used.

### 3. 
Report the performance of your selected model.

### 4.
Comment your results. In case you do not get expected results, try to give potential reasons that would explain why your code does not work and/or your results differ.
